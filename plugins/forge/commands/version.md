# /forge:version

You are cutting a release for this project. `/forge:version` determines the current version and bumps it. It updates `VERSION.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. It creates an annotated Git tag and pushes it. It works for code projects, writing projects, and the forge plugin itself.

It does not open a PR or push a branch. It only handles the tag.

The requested bump level or version is: $ARGUMENTS

Accepted bump levels are `major`, `minor`, and `patch`. An explicit version string looks like `1.2.3` or `v1.2.3`. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user what kind of bump they want.

## Orientation

Determine the current version. Check these sources in this order, and use the first one found.

1. A `VERSION.md` file at the repo root, containing a single version string.
2. Git tags matching a semver pattern, such as `v1.2.3` or `1.2.3`. Use the most recent one by semver ordering, not by date.
3. A version field in a manifest file. Examples include `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `composer.json`, or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
4. If no version is found anywhere, treat the current version as `0.0.0`. Tell the user this is the first tagged release.

## Workflow

Follow the `token-budget` skill in this plugin for session management.

1. Report the current version and the new version the requested bump will produce. Ask the user to confirm before proceeding. Do not tag without confirmation.
2. Update `VERSION.md` with the new version string, as a single line.
3. Update `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` if it exists, even if this project is forge itself. Set its `version` field to the new version string. This field gates whether `claude plugin update` can see new releases, so it must never fall behind `VERSION.md`.
4. Update version references in other manifest files, if they exist. Check `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, and `composer.json`. Do not search and replace the version string across the entire repo. Only update known manifest files and version-specific locations.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md`. Add a new section at the top, below the `# Changelog` heading. Populate it with commit subjects since the last tag, grouped by commit type from the `conventional-commits` skill. Follow the same format as the existing entries.
6. Commit the version bump, the changelog update, and any manifest changes, together. Follow the `conventional-commits` skill. Use `chore(release): v{version}` as the commit message.
7. Create an annotated Git tag. Use `v{version}` as the tag name. The tag message is `v{version}`, followed by a blank line. After that, add a brief summary of what changed, pulled from the changelog.
8. Push the tag, using `git push origin v{version}`. Also push the commit from step 6.
9. Report the new version, the tag name, and the tag's remote URL. Follow the `writing-style` skill for the report's prose. If this project has CI that triggers on tags, remind the user to check that it ran successfully.

## What this command does not do

- It does not push branches or open PRs. That is `/forge:ship`.
- It does not publish to any platform. Publishing to Gumroad, KDP, npm, or any registry is handled by CI pipelines the tag triggers, or by the user manually.
- It does not decide what version to use without user confirmation. It always asks before tagging.
